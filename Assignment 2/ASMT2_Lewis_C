 html is universal 
 empty elements don't need an end tag
 an html document is just a text file
 doctype tells what type of file it is
everything goes in between html
h1 it the largest text font
you have to use <br> for line breaks you can't just leave space
comments are added with <!--comments-->
&nbsp puts space between the words
